### Live Demo: https://gloyens.github.io/responsive-website/

## What is this project?
This is a responsive website made in HTML and CSS. Resize the browser window to change the layout.

## Aim
As my first website this serves as my introduction to web development. I made this to practice what I had learned in HTML and CSS, with a focus on making sure the website worked on devices of different sizes.
